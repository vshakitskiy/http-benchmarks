# http-benchmarks 

This repo is for comparing [mist](https://github.com/rawhat/mist) to some other webserver libraries.

## Setup

This was run with both the client and servers on the same machine.

The specs are:

|Part|Spec|
|---|---|
|OS|   WSL Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS (Windows 11 24H2)|
|CPU|  i5-13500H (16 threads)|
|RAM|  16GB|

The frameworks tested are:
  - Express (node 18.19.1)
  - Express 16-cluster (node 18.19.1)
  - Bandit (OTP 28 / Elixir 1.18.4)
  - Cowboy (OTP 28)
  - Mist (OTP 28)
  - Go (1.24.6)

Each of these sample projects has a `run.sh` file in its respective directory.
That's what I have been executing to start up the server.  These should
hopefully cover the "production" build for these.  Obviously please tell me
if you think I should be running something differently!  I want these results
to be as fair and explanatory as possible (for a relatively synthetic
benchmark, obviously).

NOTE:  I previously had flask + gunicorn in the test results, but was unable
to get the runner script executions to pass.  I'm not really sure why that's
happening at the moment, but for now I just omitted that case.

You can view the tests in `run.sh` but the cases are:

    - GET / -> ""
    - GET /user/:id -> id
    - POST /user -> <body>

Each application was tested with [h2load](https://nghttp2.org/documentation/h2load-howto.html) with 30s for each case noted above.  These tests were repeated with the concurrency flag set to 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16.
